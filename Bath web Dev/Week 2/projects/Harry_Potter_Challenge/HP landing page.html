       <h3>The Horntail</h3>

        <p>"Harry put his hand into the silk bag and pulled out the Hungarian Horntail, and the number four."
            â€” The miniature dragon[src]
            Due to his earlier espionage, Harry Potter was, in fact, aware of the sole remaining choice before he
            drew it from the bag of selection. According to Charles Weasley, she could shoot fire forty feet. He
            felt sorry for whomever got the Horntail, as its "back end's as dangerous as its front", and felt unable
            to tell his mother of the terrors awaiting Harry. [2] He proceeded the inevitable and drew the tiny
            Horntail model dragon depicting the from the bag, revealing his opponent to the rest of the occupants in
            the Waiting Tent.</p>
